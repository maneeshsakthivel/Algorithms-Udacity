Task 0 - 

Since accesing using index would be O(1) and the elements are being accesed via their indexes the overall complexity would be O(1)
Overall Complexity - O(1)

Task 1 - 

2 for loops so it would be O(n) but since the dictionary update function takes O(1)
Overall complexity - O(n)

Task 2 - 
Only one for loop which would be O(n)

Overall complexity - O(n)

Task 3 -

Part A - 

Since the list.sort() takes O(nlogn) which is greater than the complexity of the for loop the overall complexity would be O(nlogn)
Overall complexity - O(nlogn)

Part B - 

Overall complexity - O(n)

Task 4 - 
The list.remove() takes O(n) and the if-in line also takes O(n) making the for loop O(n^3)

Overall complexity - O(n^3)
