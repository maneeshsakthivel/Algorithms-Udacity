Task 0 - 

Since accesing using index would be O(1) and the elements are being accesed via their indexes the overall complexity would be O(1)
Overall Complexity - O(1)

Task 1 - 

2 for loops so it would be O(n) but since the dictionary update function takes O(n) so it would be O(n^2)
Overall complexity - O(n^2)

Task 2 - 

Overall complexity - O(n^2)

Task 3 -

Part A - 

Since the list.sort() takes O(nlogn) which is greater than the complexity of the for loop the overall complexity would be O(nlogn)
Overall complexity - O(nlogn)

Part B - 

Overall complexity - O(n)

Task 4 - 

3 loops each taking O(n) but the list.sort function takes O(nlogn) 
But the list.remove() takes O(n) making the for loops O(n^2)
Overall complexity - O(n^2)
